    <p>HowdyGroup holds design portfolio workshops for urban design, architecture, and landscape architecture major students who are applying for overseas masterâ€™s and doctoral programs or jobs to improve their portfolio quality. Our instructors are graduates of U.S. / U.K. graduate schools in these three majors; we know what an eye-catching design portfolio should look like.</p>
    <p>We peer review your past projects, help you refine your design ideas based on which improvements will be made. For new projects, we help you brainstorm design concepts, develop the design process, and set standards for your products. At the technical level, we instruct you on hand drawing, 3D modeling, computer rendering, and finally, help you with documentation, translation, and typesetting.</p>
