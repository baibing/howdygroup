            With rapid development and increasing urbanization, China has become one of the world’s largest “construction sites” with tremendous opportunities for planners and designers. As you may know, several industry leaders such as Gensler, KPF, HOK, AECOM, etc, have already laid claim in this giant market. We encourage you to follow suit as considerable market potential is still available and up for the taking.

            If your firm has no assets or infrastructure in the Chinese market, yet this is something your firm is considering, then HowdyGroup might be your best choice; partnering with us instead of installing your own local branch office is much easier and more cost effective. Our young planners and designers have an overseas educational background and training in planning & design.  Consequently, we speak both Mandarin and English, we know Chinese building codes and regulations, and most importantly, we know the culture and how to engage in business activities with Chinese clients. We can serve as bridge between your firm and Chinese clients, and work with you on any planning & design projects.

            As you can see on our website, HowdyGroup does planning & design consulting too; you may wonder why we help your firm in discovering and executing projects in China? The answer is, our young planners and designers are not experienced enough to be qualified for certain large projects, and we do not wish to say “no” to our clients. When this happens, we will turn such projects over to you (our partner firm), should you be interested in accepting. As a result, we do have standards in choosing our partner firms. Your firm should be internationally renowned and possess considerable experience in projects related to the task at hand. We will evaluate your firm’s background, considering factors such as how many registered architects and licensed landscape architects your firm has, as well as your existing and future projects.

            If your firm becomes a partner of HowdyGroup, we will contact you when our Chinese clients bring projects that we are not qualified to take on. Payment for us will be project-based, which will be a portion of the consulting/design fee that the clients pay to you; the actual portion depends on the workload and our negotiation.
